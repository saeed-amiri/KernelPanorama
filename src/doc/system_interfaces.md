# Virtual file systems:
Files which are not written on the hard disk, but only on the RAM and created on boot.
These files contains information about the system and hardware through virtual files.
There are three of them: `/sys`, `/proc`, and `/dev`

### `/proc`

Gives a dynamics view of the system and process-related information.

This is a virtual file system (`procfs`) and it is dynamically generated by the kernel.

**Usage:**

- Shows the process details, can be seen in `/proc/<PID>/`, this contains various information about the process with id of "PID"
- Contains system wide information, i.e.,  `/proc/cpuinfo`, `/proc/meminfo`
- Allows interaction with kernel parameters: `/proc/sys/`

**Example:**
```bash
cat /proc/cputinfo
```

### `/sys`:

Gives structured interface for accessing the kernel and hardware parameters.

Virtual filesystem (`sysfs`), managed by the kernel.


**Usage:**
- Used for device and driver management (`/sys/class`, `/sys/bus`)
- Allows user to interact with hardware parameters dynamically
- Shows kernel configurations options

**Example:**
```bash
ls /sys/class/net  # List network interfaces
cat /sys/block/sda/size  # Get disk size
echo "performance" | sudo tee /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_governor  # Set cpu governer
```

### `/dev`:

Represent hardware devices as files, enabling communication between user-space and hardware.

It is a virtual filesystem (`devfs`), created dynamically buy `udev`

**Usage:**
- Have devices files `/dev/sda/` for disk, `/dev/null` for null device
- User-space applications can interact with hardware through theses files

**Example:**
```bash
ls /dev  # List available device files
cat /dev/input/mouse0  # Read mouse input
echo "Hello" > /dev/pts/1  # Send test to another terminal session
```
