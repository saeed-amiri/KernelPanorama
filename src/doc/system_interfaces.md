# Virtual file systems:
Files which are not written on the hard disk, but only on the RAM and created on boot.
These files contains information about the system and hardware through virtual files.
There are three of them: `/sys`, `/proc`, and `/dev`

### `/proc`
> Gives a dynamics view of the system and process-related information.
> This is a virtual file system (`procfs`) and it is dynamically generated by the kernel.
> Usage:
>> Shows the process details, can be seen in `/proc/<pid>/`
>> Contains system wide information, i.e.,  `/proc/cpuinfo`, `/proc/meminfo`
>> Allows interaction with kernel parameters: `/proc/sys/`
> example:
```bash
cat /proc/cputinfo
```
