# What is Memory Management in the Kernel?
The kernel manages memory through a complex system that includes:
## Physical & Virtual Memory Mapping:
 
   - In OS like Linux, processes do not directly access physical memory (`RAM`). Instead, the kernel provides each process with a virtual address space, and the Memory Management Unit (`MMU`) translates virtual addressees memory locations:
   - Physical memory is the actual `RAM` on installed on the system,
   - Virtual Memory is an abstraction provided by the OS, each process gets its own isolated memory space.

**Why Virtual Memory**:
- Process isolation: each proxies gets a private address space to prevent accidental corruption.
- Efficient Memory Utilization: The kernel loads only needed memory pages.
- Address Space Expansion Programs can use memory than physical available by swapping memory to disk.
- Security Prevents processes from accessing each other's memory.

**How Virtual Memory Works: Address Translation**
- The CPU does not directly access `RAM`.
- Instead, it sends virtual addresses to the `MMU`, which translates into physical addresses.
- The page table maps virtual addresses to physical addresses.
```bash
cat /proc/self/maps  # See the virtual memory layout of a process.
ffffffffff600000-ffffffffff601000 --xp 00000000 00:00 0                  [vsyscall]
# ffffffffff600000-ffffffffff601000: start and end addresses of the mapped memory region
# --xp: memory permission, here it mean: Not readable, not writable, but executable, Private mapping (not shared with other processes).
# 00000000 is offset in the mapped file, and here it means the memory starts from the beginning
# 00:00: Device, here, this is not backed by an actual file (a virtual memory)
# 0: Inode, here it means no associated file on disk.
# [vsyscall]: is alegacy virtual system call region. For fast system calls.
```

## Kernel vs. User-Space Memory:

Linux uses a virtual memory system, i.e.,:

-   User-space applications run in an isolated address space, and cannot directly access kernel memory
-   The kernel runs in privileged mode and can access all memory.

-   This prevents user-space programs from corrupting kernel memory.
-   The kernel must map user-space memory when needed.

## Pages & Page Tables in Linux Kernel Memory Management

### What is Page?
A page is the smallest unit of memory management in the modern operating systems of handling memory byte-by-byte, Linux breaks it into fixed-sized blocks called pages.

**Page Basics**

- Page size is 4 KB (on x86-64 systems).
- Divides memory into fixed chunks instead of variable-sized regions.
- Simplifies memory allocation and swapping.
- Each process gets its own set of pages.
In terminal:
```bash
getconf PAGESIZE
4096
```
also:
```bash
cat /proc/meminfo | grep Page
```

### What is Page Table:
Since the OS uses virtual memory, each process does nit directly access physical memory. instead, the `MMU` translates the virtual memory addresses into physical memory addresses using page tables.
-   One can compare to a phone book:
-   virtual addresses are like people's names,
-   physical assresses are like phone numbers.
-   The page table acts as the lookup table between them
* A process accesses a virtual address
* The MMU looks up the page table to find the corresponding physical address.
* The CPU accesses the correct memory location

**How Page Tables Work:**
Because modern systems have huge amounts of RAM, a single-level page table would be too large. Instead, Linux uses a multi-level page table to keep it efficient.
- PGD (Page Global Directory) -> Top-level table pointing to P4D -> 512 (Enteries per table)
- P4D (Page 4th Level Directory) -> Points to PUD -> 512
- PUD (Page Upper Directory) -> Points to PMD -> 512
- PMD (Page Middle Directory) -> Points to PTE -> 512
- PTE (Page Table Entry) -> Maps virtual address to physical address -> 512
    
PTE entry contains the page frame number (PFN).
Offset within the page is added to find the exact byte.

### Page Faults (When a Page is Not Found):
If a process accesses a virtual address not in RAM, the MMU raises a "Page Fault".

Invalid Address â†’ Segmentation Fault (SIGSEGV).

## Paging vs. Segmentation

Paging and segmentation are two different memory management techniques. Modern Linux systems use **paging**, not segmentation.

| **Feature**        | **Paging**                                | **Segmentation**                        |
|--------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| **Memory Model**   | Fixed-size pages                | Variable-sized segments        |
| **Fragmentation**  | Solves external fragmentation  | Causes fragmentation           |
| **Speed**         | Faster lookup via page tables  | Slower due to variable sizes  |
| **Flexibility**    | Less flexible, fixed-size chunks | More flexible, variable-sized chunks |

### **Why Linux Uses Paging, Not Segmentation**
- Paging **avoids external fragmentation** by using fixed-size pages.
- It allows for **efficient virtual memory management**.
- Modern **CPUs are optimized for paging**, making it faster.
- Segmentation was **used in older architectures** (e.g., x86 real mode).

## How the Kernel Allocates Pages

The Linux kernel provides several functions for **memory allocation**, depending on the use case.

| **Function**         | **Description**                               | **Use Case**                          |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| `kmalloc(size, flags)`  | Allocates contiguous memory in physical RAM | Small kernel allocations (<1 MB) |
| `vmalloc(size)`      | Allocates large non-contiguous memory        | Large kernel memory (>1 MB) |
| `alloc_pages(flags, order)` | Allocates memory at page level (2^order pages) | Large contiguous allocations |
| `mmap()`            | Maps files/devices into user-space memory    | Shared memory, file mapping |
| `remap_pfn_range()` | Maps physical memory to user-space           | Device drivers, hardware mapping |
| `get_free_page(flags)` | Allocates a single 4 KB page               | Low-level kernel memory |

### ðŸ”¹ **Key Differences**
- **`kmalloc()`** is **fast** but **only works for small allocations** because it requires contiguous physical memory.
- **`vmalloc()`** works for **large allocations** by mapping non-contiguous memory into a contiguous virtual space.
- **`alloc_pages()`** is used for **direct page-level allocations** (useful for multi-page kernel buffers).
- **`mmap()`** allows mapping **files or hardware memory into user space**.
